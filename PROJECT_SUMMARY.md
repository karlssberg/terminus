# Terminus Project Summary

## Overview

Terminus is a lightweight .NET framework for creating generic server-side endpoints that can be wired up to any infrastructure. It enables developers to use POCO (Plain Old CLR Objects) types as entrypoints to their services by decorating methods with custom attributes.

## What Was Built

### Core Framework Components

1. **IEndpoint Interface** (`IEndpoint.cs`)
   - Marker interface for endpoint classes
   - Simple, non-intrusive design

2. **EndpointAttribute** (`EndpointAttribute.cs`)
   - Attribute for marking methods as endpoints
   - Supports custom names and tags
   - Fully documented with XML comments

3. **EndpointMetadata** (`EndpointMetadata.cs`)
   - Contains metadata about discovered endpoints
   - Stores type, method, name, tags, and attribute information
   - Thread-safe and immutable

4. **EndpointDiscovery** (`EndpointDiscovery.cs`)
   - Static class for discovering endpoints in assemblies and types
   - Supports scanning entire assemblies or specific types
   - Uses reflection to find decorated methods

5. **EndpointRegistry** (`EndpointRegistry.cs`)
   - Thread-safe registry for managing discovered endpoints
   - Query by name or tag
   - Supports bulk registration from assemblies or types

6. **EndpointInvoker** (`EndpointInvoker.cs`)
   - Utility for invoking endpoint methods
   - Supports both sync and async methods
   - Automatically handles Task and Task<T> return types

### Test Suite

Comprehensive test coverage with 23 tests across 3 test classes:

1. **EndpointDiscoveryTests** (8 tests)
   - Tests endpoint discovery in types and assemblies
   - Validates custom names and tags
   - Tests error handling

2. **EndpointRegistryTests** (10 tests)
   - Tests registration and retrieval
   - Validates querying by name and tag
   - Tests thread-safety with concurrent dictionary

3. **EndpointInvokerTests** (5 tests)
   - Tests synchronous and asynchronous invocation
   - Validates parameter passing
   - Tests Task<T> handling

### Sample Application

Comprehensive sample demonstrating:
- Simple synchronous endpoints (Calculator)
- Tagged endpoints (UserService)
- Async endpoints (AsyncService)
- Endpoint discovery and registration
- Tag-based querying
- Endpoint invocation

### Documentation

1. **README.md** - Comprehensive guide with:
   - Features overview
   - Installation instructions
   - Quick start guide
   - Usage examples
   - Core components documentation
   - Use cases

2. **CHANGELOG.md** - Version history and release notes

3. **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Guidelines for contributors

4. **CI/CD** - GitHub Actions workflow for:
   - Building on push/PR
   - Running tests
   - Creating NuGet packages
   - Uploading artifacts

### NuGet Package

- **Package Name**: Terminus
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Target Framework**: .NET 8.0
- **License**: MIT
- **Size**: ~11KB
- **Includes**: XML documentation for IntelliSense

## Key Features

✅ Infrastructure Agnostic - Decouple from specific implementations
✅ Attribute-Based - Simple method decoration
✅ Automatic Discovery - Scan assemblies for endpoints
✅ Flexible Invocation - Support sync and async methods
✅ Tagging System - Organize endpoints with tags
✅ Type-Safe - Strongly-typed metadata with full reflection
✅ Extensible - Easy to extend for custom integrations
✅ Thread-Safe - Safe for concurrent use
✅ Well-Documented - Full XML docs and README
✅ Well-Tested - 23 comprehensive tests

## Project Statistics

- **Core Library Files**: 6 C# files
- **Test Files**: 3 C# test classes
- **Total Tests**: 23 (all passing)
- **Lines of Production Code**: ~392
- **Lines of Test Code**: ~464
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive (all major code paths)
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: 0 (CodeQL verified)

## Use Cases

### 1. Library Authors
Create reusable endpoint libraries that can be consumed by any infrastructure:
```csharp
public class PaymentEndpoints : IEndpoint
{
    [Endpoint]
    public PaymentResult ProcessPayment(PaymentRequest request) { ... }
}
```

### 2. Service Decoupling
Decouple business logic from infrastructure concerns:
```csharp
public class OrderService : IEndpoint
{
    [Endpoint]
    public Order CreateOrder(CreateOrderRequest request) { ... }
}
```

### 3. Multi-Protocol Services
Expose the same endpoints through multiple protocols (REST, gRPC, messaging, WebSocket).

## Technology Stack

- **.NET 8.0** - Target framework
- **C# 12** - Language version
- **xUnit** - Testing framework
- **GitHub Actions** - CI/CD
- **NuGet** - Package distribution

## Quality Assurance

✅ All builds pass
✅ All 23 tests pass
✅ CodeQL security scan: 0 vulnerabilities
✅ Sample application runs successfully
✅ NuGet package creates successfully
✅ Full XML documentation generated
✅ CI/CD workflow configured

## Next Steps

The framework is ready for:
1. Publishing to NuGet.org
2. Creating infrastructure adapters (ASP.NET Core, gRPC, etc.)
3. Adding more advanced features (middleware, validation, etc.)
4. Community contributions

## Conclusion

Terminus successfully achieves its goal of providing a lightweight, infrastructure-agnostic framework for creating server-side endpoints. The implementation is clean, well-tested, fully documented, and ready for production use.
